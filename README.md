This is a project done for a Fiverr customer. 

The instructions were as follows:

I am looking to have a simple timer made in react.
- Full width and Height of Browser window
- Timer Numbers are whatever font (I can change it later)
- Timer is centered in the screen.
- Timer is "activated" when the Spacebar is Held (hold for a couple seconds and the timer text turns green or something)
- Timer STARTS when the Spacebar is released.
- Timer STOPS when ANY key is pressed.
- Pressing Escape will reset the timer back to 0
- Simple dropdown menu on top that turns on "dark mode" (black BG, white text)
- Dropdown can also have a "how to" link, which is just a popup that tells instructions.

I can add Logos and touch up the CSS after it is complete. I have attached some sample images. Does this sound like something you can do?
